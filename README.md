# c
A repo to store all my c code from my learning journey.

To make things easier for me on my learning journey, I have created a a bash file to compile and run my c and delete the output file after running.

To use, you just alias run to ./run (ie alias run="./run") for the first time then you type (run "filename") in the command line.
